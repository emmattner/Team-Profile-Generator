## Description
Here I have created a Team Profile Generator.

This is an application that takes user command-line input to generate an HTML webpage with a stylesheet through the use of Inquirer module from Node.js.

## Installation Instructions
The user can clone the repository from Github into their directory and open the integrated terminal and ``'npm install'`` all necessary dependencies. Run ``'node index.js'`` to begin creating employee cards. If wanting to run tests enter ``'npm run test'`` into the command line; this will load and run tests and return passed.

## Usage Information
By using inquirer through your command line the user can add team members to a profile through the command-line in terminal using the following dependencies:
* Inquirer
* Node.js
* Jest
* NPM
